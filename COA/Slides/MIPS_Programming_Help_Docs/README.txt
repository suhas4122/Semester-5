This folder contains several useful resources to get started
with MIPS-32 programming, using the QtSPIM/SPIM simulator. The contents
of this folder are decribed below:

1. README.txt: this README file.

2. combined_SPIM.pdf: MIPS-32 tutorial and SPIM manual (detailed).

3. MIPS_cheat_sheet.pdf: MIPS-32 cheat sheet (1 page).  

4. MIPS_Quick_Reference.pdf: MIPS-32 Quick Reference (very useful!!)

5. sum_two_nums.s: Simple MIPS-32 program to add two numbers 
  input by the user.

6. sum_iterative.s: Simple MIPS-32 program to calculate the sum of 
  the first $n$ natural numbers, where the value of $n$ is collected 
  from the user. This program exemplifies the loop control 
  structure in MIPS-32.
